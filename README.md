# nginx-static-webserver
Nginx (pronounced "engine-x") is an open source reverse proxy server for HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, POP3, and IMAP protocols, as well as a load balancer, HTTP cache, and a web server (origin server). The nginx project started with a strong focus on high concurrency, high performance and low memory usage.

You can use my docker compose file or check at https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx. Before deploying grab nginx.conf file with nginx settings.
